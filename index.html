            <p class="job">My name is Hank, and I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer with a deep passion for creating innovative and scalable web applications. With expertise spanning both front-end and back-end development, I have a comprehensive understanding of the entire development process, from initial design to deployment and maintenance.

                On the front end, I specialize in crafting responsive, intuitive user interfaces using modern frameworks such as React and Vue.js. My focus is on creating seamless user experiences that are both visually appealing and highly functional.
                
                On the back end, I have extensive experience working with Node.js, Express, and various databases like MongoDB and SQL. I take pride in writing efficient, maintainable code, ensuring that applications can scale easily and perform optimally under pressure.
                
                I am always eage.r to explore new technologies, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and continually improve my skill set. Whether it's developing an enterprise-level application or working on a personal project, I am driven by the desire to solve complex problems through creative coding solutions..</p>
